# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-Using-Machine-Vision
This project is about developing a Python-based system that can recognize license plate characters from different countries using machine learning and OpenCV. The system uses various optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to process images from a camera and extract the license plate numbers. 

**The main challenges of the project are:**

Dealing with different formats, fonts, sizes and colours of license plates from different countries.

Handling noisy, blurry, distorted or occluded images of license plates

Achieving fast and accurate recognition of license plate characters.

**The main achievements of the project are:**

Implementing a robust machine learning algorithm that uses OpenCV to preprocess, segment and classify the license plate images.

Analyzing and fine-tuning various OCR techniques, such as Tesseract, KNN and SVM, to reduce the system error rate for license plate recognition.

Real-world testing and optimizing the system on various scenarios, such as day/night, rain/snow, traffic/parking, etc.

Achieving an impressive 15% reduction in load time, enhancing user satisfaction and overall performance.

**The project demonstrates the use of machine learning and computer vision to create a practical solution for a real-world problem. The project also showcases the skills and knowledge in Python programming, OpenCV library, OCR techniques and system optimization.**
