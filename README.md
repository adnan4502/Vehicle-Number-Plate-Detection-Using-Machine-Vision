# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-Using-Machine-Vision
This project is about developing a Python-based system that can recognize license plate characters from different countries using machine learning and OpenCV. The system uses various optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to process images from a camera and extract the license plate numbers.
